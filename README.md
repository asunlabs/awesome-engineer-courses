# asunlabs/courses

This is a repository where I document a list of courses/lectures I took/will take. It is a personal history and recommendation, which does not grant any kind of authrotity or certification. Courses are labelled as follows. Link for each lecture will be added for people who also want to take the courses.

Contribution is wide-open. Feel free to open a pull request.
